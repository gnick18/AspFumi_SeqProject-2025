First box:
Welcome to the Aspergillus fumigatus Af293/CEA10 community sequencing initiative.

Working with shared genetic isolates is crucial for scientific communities, as it allows labs to reliably compare findings on physiology, pathogenicity, and genetic perturbations. This project is a collaborative effort by researchers worldwide who use the A. fumigatus model isolates Af293 and/or CEA10.

Our goal is to determine the genetic similarity between these globally distributed strains while providing all sequencing data back to the contributing labs.

# FAQs
Q: What type of labs are we looking to collaborate with?
A: Do you use the model isolates Af293 or CEA10 in your research? If so, we want your help!

Q: What do I need to do to get involved?
A: We need two things from each collaborating lab:

1. DNA extracted from your isolate, sent to our sequencing hub in Jena, Germany.

2. A completed short (5 min) metadata survey with some basic information about your lab and the strain you are sending.

Q: What does my research team get out of this collaboration?
A: We will sequence your lab's isolate of Af293 or CEA10 for free and will provide your group with the resulting genome assembly and annotation files in real-time. In addition, the principal investigator from each collaborating lab will be offered co-authorship on the publication summarizing our findings.

Q: Will the genome from my lab's isolate be shared publicly?
A: To ensure confidentiality, each genome will be assigned an anonymous code and will only be shared directly with the lab that provided the strain during the analysis phase. For the final publication and data release, all genomes will be identified only by their anonymous code, making them untraceable to a specific lab. The only researchers with access to the full, non-anonymized dataset during the project will be the leadership team.
