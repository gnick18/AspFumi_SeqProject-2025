# First meeting on the community sequencing project

I'm going to take meeting notes and will create a GitHub repo or OneDrive shared folder for us to all use after this meeting.



5k to the sequencing; maybe more; I'll look at my own budget for this to make another 5-10k contribution

Illumina otherwise:

- For the money Amelia could do the sequening in Europe; we maybe could do the DNA extraction in Madison



$100 and $120 Euros 

(we would offer to anonymize the different strains for the different labs but would offer to notify the labs; we can offer to make available the strains right now)



*Aspergillus genomes research policy committee*: as apart of this they have a list of names and contacts for everyone 



**October to end of Dec:** We can set a putative goal of getting this done by the end of the year; 

- Website to host this
- Building out a google form; I'll put the questions that I think labs should be asked



**Af293 and CEA10:** lets do both at the begining 



Either would be ideal for the DNA extraction



Jena; Madison; Asia hub; India hub; South America; 



Pan-genome graph (usually when you build an assembly there is a genome graph for this)

- Look into this after the meeting
