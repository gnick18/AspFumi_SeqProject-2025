# List of final changes I would like you to implement
1. On the metadata form that labs fill out we need to have an option at the bottom that users can click to opt out of having their lab information included on the Map tool. Ideally we would have two options for such users, one removes there lab name but keeps their institution name to give the lab some anonminity, the other option would make sure nothing is adding to the map at all (full opt out). Of course we still need to be saving all of this information on the back end like the current form is designed to do. 
2. Change the abot this initative to have the following text:

Welcome to the *Aspergillus fumigatus* Af293/CEA10 community sequencing initiative.

The model isolates Af293 and CEA10 have been used by researchers for decades. As these strains have been independently cultured in labs across the globe, they have likely accumulated unique, unstudied mutations. Understanding the extent of this "lab-to-lab" evolution is crucial to reliably compare findings on physiology, pathogenicity, and genetics.

While community sequencing projects have been conducted for other model organisms, this effort is the first of its kind for a filamentous fungus. We believe *A. fumigatus* is the perfect model pathogen to pioneer this work.

Our goal is to quantify the genetic divergence between all of our labs' parental Af293 and CEA10 strains and create a foundational genomic resource for the entire *Aspergillus* community. All sequencing data will be provided back to the contributing labs.
